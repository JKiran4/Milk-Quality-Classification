# Milk Classification

The introduction of machine learning models has reshaped the landscape of many industries, assisting in tasks such as process optimization, predictions, and classification. In recent years, milk producers have taken an interest in how they can effectively leverage classification-based models to determine the quality of their milk. In this project, we explore the use of several machine learning methods to classify milk into three grades: low (bad), medium (moderate), or high (good). 

The dataset we use is a collection of 1059 manually collected observations of milk associated with seven key features: pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Colour with the corresponding quality grade. With our analysis, we compare four supervised learning methods and one unsupervised learning method to evaluate which model can predict milk quality with the highest degree of accuracy. Our best-performing method provides a gateway for machine learning in the milk industry, providing a tool to reliably monitor and improve milk production quality. 

This repository contains our analysis in the form of a Jupyter Notebook: `Final_Project_Workbook.ipynb` as well as the dataset that we use in the form of a CSV file: `milknew.csv`.
